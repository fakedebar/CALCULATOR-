This C++ calculator program performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user for an operation and two numerical inputs. It includes robust input validation, ensuring that the user enters valid numbers and operations. If the user enters invalid input (such as strings or incorrect operations), the program will display an error message and prompt the user to try again until valid inputs are provided. The program also handles division by zero gracefully.
